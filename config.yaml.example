  # Note that you need to ssh as `root` if you want to have the program to show `smartctl` output
  # (because `smartctl` requires `root`) or the firewall logs (since the firewall log file is only readable by `root`).
  # If you don't need either of those, remove those part of the program, and change this to any limited user with shell access instead.
